# NIST-Omran

## Overview

This repository is for working with raw IQ data from SDR/radio hardware and
visualizing live RF measurements. The main project-specific code is in `live/`,
which contains several versions of a live two-channel spectrogram and PSD
viewer workflow.

## About striqt

`striqt/` is the supporting acquisition and analysis library (courtesy of the folks at NIST - Dr. Dan Kuester & Aric Sanders) used here for RF/IQ acquisition and analysis workflows. It has its own README and
documentation, so this file focuses on the live visualization scripts in this repo.

## Live Visualization Scripts

`live/` contains multiple versions of the same general live IQ visualization
workflow:

- `striqt_frontend_TCP.py` + `striqt_server_TCP.py`
  - Frontend/backend (respectively) version for two devices.
  - The server runs on the AIR-T/AIR8201 side, uses `striqt` for acquisition,
    and streams spectrogram frames over TCP.
  - The viewer runs on another machine, connects to the server, and provides the
    PyQt/pyqtgraph spectrogram and PSD UI.
  - Use this when the radio host and display machine are separate.

- `striqt_standalone_terminal.py`
  - Terminal-only standalone live monitor.
  - Runs acquisition and display in one process using a curses UI, without Qt or
    pyqtgraph.
  - Use this over SSH or when a graphical desktop is not available.
  - Codex made this, so if anything weird happens, I'd like you all to blame W. Tyler Reichenberg of Purdue University.

- `striqt_standalone.py`
  - Full standalone GUI version.
  - Combines the `striqt` radio backend and the PyQt/pyqtgraph viewer in one
    process, with no TCP server/client split.
  - Use this when the radio host can also run the GUI.


## Quick Usage

Run commands from the repository root unless noted otherwise.

- Networked `striqt` server and viewer:

  ```sh
  python3 live/striqt_server_TCP.py
  python3 live/striqt_frontend_TCP.py <server-ip>
  ```

- Terminal standalone monitor (adjust settings accordingly):

  ```sh
  python3 live/striqt_standalone_terminal.py --center-mhz 1955 --rate-msps 15.36 --nfft 1024 --rows 40 --fps 3
  ```

- Full standalone GUI:

  ```sh
  python3 live/striqt_standalone.py
  ```

## Notes

- The live scripts assume the needed SDR hardware, drivers, Python packages, and
  `striqt` imports are available on the machine running acquisition.
- `striqt_frontend_TCP.py` defaults to `192.168.50.1:5005`; pass a host or `--port` when
  using a different network setup.
